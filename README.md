# Edge-AI-for-ECG
The project seeks to design an Internet of Things (IoT) device empowering  individuals with accessible yet efficient monitoring capabilities over their heart health status. 
To collect relevant physiological data we employ a three lead sensor that can effectively 
capture a persons electrocardiogram signals for heart function measurements. Those signals 
feed into our specialized one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1 D CNN) model 
developed to assess heart health. 
 Once this model is trained and fine tuned. We streamline its transferability via creating a 
header file. This file enables simple deployment on minimal resource processor units such as 
ESP32 while maintaining performance efficiency and accuracy.
